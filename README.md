## rust-learning

I am learning [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org) which **_is a systems programming language that runs blazingly fast, prevents segfaults, and guarantees thread safety_**. When I use *Rust* to implement projects of [Patch Lab](https://github.com/patchlab), I wrote some pieces of *Rust* code. I collect the codes in this repository, and hopeful could help others.
